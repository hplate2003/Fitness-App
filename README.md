Driven by my passion for fitness, I embarked on creating a Fitness Tracker web application. This project was a personal endeavor to bring my vision to life and fulfill specific requirements. The following outlines the key features and goals I aim to achieve with this application.

Vison/Concept:


User Profile:

~ Personal Info.(name, age, gender, weight, height)

~ Fitness Goals(weightloss, muscle gain, endurance, going up in weight)
        - Also I want to be able to add the date of when you want to have achieved your goal by



Workout Tracking:

~ Manual Entry of Workouts
        - Be able to view them in categories depending on what you hit for variety(categories: Back & Bi, Quads, Chest, etc.)

~ Log workouts daily by picking the different exercises & recording weight used, reps, & sets
        - Should also include an option for a "rest day"

~ Be able to connect to smart watches to show daily steps, heart rate, etc.



Progress Tracking:

~ Includes a folder where you can upload all Dexa Body Scans so they are compiled in one place and you can compare them over time

~ Be able to take progress pictures & have them stored by the date
        - When clicked on it should connect you to the workout you did that day

~ Enter everything daily, but it would be cool if it gave you weekly updates as encouragement based on goals/changes/improvements



Nutrition Tracking:

~ Calorie Intake

~ Track Macros

~ Food Diary(breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, water)

~ Calculate Daily Protein Amount Based On Weight



Sleep Tracking:

~ Tracks the Number of Hours of Sleep 


***It would be cool to see an average page per week & be able to compare to other weeks or like a weekly summary***
***It would also be cool if you were able to connect with friends and share achievements***
